FingerPrintManager & BioMetric:

The FingerprintManager class was introduced in Android 6.0 (API level 23). At the time -- and up until Android 9 (API level 28) -- the API provided support only for fingerprint sensors, and with no UI. Developers needed to build their own fingerprint UI.

Based on developer feedback, Android 9 introduced a standardized fingerprint UI policy. In addition, BiometricPrompt was introduced to encompass more sensors than just fingerprint.

First we have to set the fingerprint in your mobile settings.(Goto Settings --> Fingerprint & Security) --> Add the finger print--> Wait sometime until the progress completed --> Done.

Launch the app click the use biometric and print the fingerprint which is the correct one you added in the settings.
